# Fifteen Sliding Puzzle maker for HTML 

A simple implementation of the classic mini-game Fifteen Sliding Puzzle, using HTML DOM document elements and without using Canvas or third party libraries. 

When mixing a picture, random replacement of slots is not used, only natural mixing by moving a free slot, thanks to this, an error is excluded, due to which the puzzle may not be assembled.

By solving the puzzle, you can move several blocks in a column and a row in one move. You can set controls for the GamePad and keyboard.

The engine code is very flexible for modifications, has many settings and can be integrated into any web page or web app.

        var setup={
             puzzle_fifteen:{
                diff:300,           // Number of movements of the slots for shuffling pictures
                size:[512,640],     // Clement size "fifteen" in pixels only
                grid:[3,3],         // The number of squares in the height and width of the picture
                fill:true,          // Stretching the area with the game to fit the element is recommended for fullscreen
                number:true,        // Slot sequence number
                art:{
